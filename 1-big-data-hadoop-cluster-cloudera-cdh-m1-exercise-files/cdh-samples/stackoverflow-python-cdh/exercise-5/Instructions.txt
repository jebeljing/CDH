Exercise 5: Installing Linux from Scratch with CentOS

1.	Download the corresponding CentOS .iso
2.	Create a new virtual machine in Virtual Box, call it “Base Linux Machine”, selecting Red Hat 64-bit 
a.	We will clone this machine and use it for several different roles
3.	Select RAM, in my case I will select 2GiB and at least 2 CPUs. This will change based on the role that you will use each machine for 
4.	Create virtual hard disk now, dynamically allocated and with enough space
a.	I use expert mode to select location of disk, use the default if it you do not need a specific location
b.	I will select 80 GiB, but since it is dynamically allocated it does not consume that amount of space
5.	Go to settings and in storage, insert the CentOS .iso 
6.	Start the machine
7.	Select “Install CentOS 7” and follow the installation steps
a.	Select your language of choice and click continue
b.	Select the installation destination, namely the disk you have just crated and click Done
c.	Click on “Begin Installation”
d.	And add a root password. I will set it to cloudera
e.	Wait for the installation to be completed
f.	When done, reboot and log in with root/cloudera
g.	Check for version to make sure you have a supported CentOS version by using “cat /etc/centos-release”
h.	Shutdown
8.	And for good practice, take a snapshot by selecting Snapshots next to details in the Virtual Machine information area

Great. We have our base machine ready!
