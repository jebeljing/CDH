Exercise 2: Getting The Cloudera QuickStart VM Up & Running
This exercise will get you a virtual machine with all you need to get started with Big Data and Hadoop using Cloudera CDH.

Steps:
1.	Download from http://www.cloudera.com/downloads/quickstart_vms/5-8.html (or replace with current or specific version)
2.	Unzip into desired folder, i.e. \standalone-quickstart in the folder you designate as the base to use for this training's exercises
3.	From Virtual Box’s menu, go go to “File” > “Import Appliance” and select the .ovf file, in this case cloudera-quickstart-vm-5.8.0-0-virtualbox.ovf 
4.	Click next
5.	And change settings, i.e. provide a friendly name
    -	For Cloudera manager you need at least a recommended 8GiB (8192) of RAM and 2 CPUs so please change this value
    -	If you don't or can't, you are going to need to pass -force as an option later to enable Cloudera Manager
6.	Click on “Import” and wait for it to be ready - have some patience as it takes some time
7.	Start the virtual machine using Normal Start
8.  CentOS will start and you will be logged in automatically into the machine using the following credentials
    - Username: cloudera
    - Password: cloudera

Now you have a Pseudo-Cluster with Cloudera CDH and all relevant services installed.
