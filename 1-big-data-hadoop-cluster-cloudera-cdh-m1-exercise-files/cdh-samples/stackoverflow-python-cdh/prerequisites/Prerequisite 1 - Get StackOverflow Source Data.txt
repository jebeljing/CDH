* Prerequisite Instructions for Getting the Data to Use in This Exercise *
	Creating Your First Big Data Hadoop Cluster Using Cloudera CDH
	Pluralsight course by Xavier Morera

The first step is to download the exercise zip file from this course as demonstrated in the video. Once you have it inside the machine that you will use to run the exercises, please make sure that it is in a folder called stackoverflow-python-cdh as that way it will be referenced in all future exercises in that location.

For this course we will use as source the data from StackOverflow and related sites from StackExchange. Given that we have sites from a few megabytes in size to many gigabytes, you can select which dump you will like to use based on your available hardware. We will always use the Posts.xml from the dumps.

StackOverflow dumps can be located in the following page
https://archive.org/download/stackexchange

Please download the one that you would like to process, however please take into consideration that dump size varies greatly and thus you need to have enough resources in your cluster to process larger files. A small dump that can be used for analysis of data to test is:
	https://archive.org/download/stackexchange/vi.stackexchange.com.7z

A large dump can be the main programming site's dump, StackOverflow which can be found at:
	https://archive.org/download/stackexchange/stackoverflow.com-Posts.7z

To download in the Linux machine it is recommended to use wget and then p7zip for extraction which are not available by default. Instructions on how to download, expand and process file are demonstrated in the video tutorial, but you can also run these commands: 

For getting the file for processing
	wget https://archive.org/download/stackexchange/vi.stackexchange.com.7z

For installing 7zip:
	sudo yum install epel-release 
	sudo yum install p7zip p7zip-plugins
	
For extracting the data files please run the following command (replacing with the name of the downloaded dump you selected)
	7z e vi.stackexchange.com.7z

The file we need is Posts.xml, please copy it to the stackoverflow-python-cdh directory.
